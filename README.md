# Basic Python Binary Search

A basic binary search algorithm in Python.

Most likely very inefficient, and has terrible modularisation.

Just playing around in python. This was made back in year 10 (editing ReadMe in Feb-2023) interesting to see how simple my coding style was and how far I've come since then.
